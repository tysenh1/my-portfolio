## Projects

### Project 1: FTU Tracker

- **Description**: A web app for tracking player stats in the game Valorant. The website was originally written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django and MongoDB but was rewritten to use React, TailwindCSS and Next.js on the frontend and NestJS, Slonik and PostgreSQL on the backend.
- **Technologies I used**: React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, NestJS, Slonik, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Figma, VSCode

### Project 2: FTU Knowledge Base
- **Description**: A basic knowledge base I made for internal use at FTU. This website was made with express for the backend framework, pg for the database driver and PostgreSQL for the database service. The frontend uses React.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is still a work-in-progress as FTU hasn't progressed enough for it to have any use.
- **Technologies I used**: React.js, HTML, CSS, pg, express.js, PostgreSQL
